# Saving and restoring
.save(filepath) - saves model to HDF5 file
.load_model(filepath) - loads model from HDF5 file

.model_to_json, .model_to_yaml - saves only model layer structural architecture without weights to json or yaml string.
.model_from_json, .model_from_yaml - restores only model layer structural architecture from json or yaml string.

# Should be the same architecture
# Might use these to save training weights and try something different and load the old weights if the new ones aren't great.
.save_weights(filepath) - saves only the model weights to HDF5 file
.load_weights(filepath) - loads only the model weights from HDF5 file


# Sequential Model
Input -> Layer -> Layer -> Layer -> Layer -> Layer -> Layer -> Layer -> Output

# Functional API
Layers are defined separate from model and the connections between them are user defined.
These arrangements can be functional units of layers.
